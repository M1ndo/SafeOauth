SafeOauth is a TOTP key manager that functions similarly to passmenu, providing a fast way to retrieve TOTP codes.
The codes are stored locally and secured using GPG encryption to ensure their safety.

* Difference between this and pass-otp.
Couldn't find any integration with window managers, altho Xmonad has one others dont.
Quick and easy just call it with just a keybinding in your window manager.

* Dependencies.
- =pass= for secret storing and encrypting via `gpg`
- =oathtool= for generating totp codes.
- =xclip= for copying totp codes.
- =zenity= for dialogs and prompts.

* Installation
#+begin_src shell
doas wget -O /usr/local/bin/safeoauth https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M1ndo/SafeOauth/main/safeoauth.sh
doas chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/safeoauth
# OR
git clone https://github.com/m1ndo/SafeOauth && cd SafeOauth
doas make install
#+end_src

* Usage
#+begin_src shell
safeoauth --show # Show All Saved OTP's
safeoauth --create # Create a new OTP Entry
safeoauth --edit # Edit Existing Entries.
#+end_src
** Integration With Window Managers (Ex Xmonad)
Add Zenity to ensure it becomes a floating dialog instead of a window.
And add safeoauth as keybinding.
#+begin_src haskell
   className =? "Zenity"          --> doFloat
